* Full Interleave mode rewrite
After using [[https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave][interleave-mode]] for some time, I got some ideas of how I could improve it,
usability and feature-wise. As doing a refactor on a foreign codebase takes a long time,
because of the discussion with the owner (who is, of course, free to disagree with me
about it), learning its internals, proposing pull requests, more back and forth in code
review, etc, and as I like doing things from scratch, I started doing what is an ad-hoc
replacement for interleave-mode. Note that not every feature of the original mode will be
available, even when this is done! You may prefer using the original, because this is a
different take on the same idea!

The name of this package is also Interleave, /but only temporarily/, because I couldn't
think yet of a better name.

And, of course, I must thank [[https://github.com/rudolfochrist][Sebastian]] for the original idea and the inspiration!
