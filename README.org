* ORG-NOTER (fork of a fork)
** This is a fork of the *c1-g* fork with some commits picked from *dmitrym*
   - In essence, this is close to the original *weirdNox* (Gon√ßalo Santos)
     version that you find on MELPA with the refactoring that *c1-g* implemented

   - djvu and epub support have also been advanced by *c1-g*, but I have not
     tested any of that code.

   - The main new feature for PDF users is 2-D precise notes, which can be
     inserted in two ways:
     1. "Select-precise": selecting text in the pdf, followed by =M-i=.  *c1-g*
        changed the position format to use the entire list returned by =edges=.
        This breaks the other way of inserting precise notes.  On *dmitrym*'s
        fork, select-precise notes auto-fill the note title with the selected
        text.  This has deleterious side effects for other note insertion methods.
     2. "Click-precise": =M-i=, followed by clicking a location on the page.
        The location recorded by =org-noter= is typically inaccurate in the
        horizontal direction.  This is something I want to fix.


   - Standard notes can also be inserted in two ways:
     1. "TAB".  Hitting tab creates a note title "Notes for page ##", where the
        page number is inserted automatically over the octothorpes.
     2. "i".  The fundamental =org-noter-insert-note=.  User types note title
        into the minibuffer.
** Note insertion desired features
   1. The position of the precise note should be at the click (with a
      configurable horizontal offset) or at the upper-left of the selected text
      (or configurable to one of the corners or ends of the selected area).
   2. Highlighting of selected text should be a user settable configuration option
   3. For any of the note insertion methods, if there is any selected text, then
      it should be the default title.  (or there should be a configurable
      switch)
   4. Add property and/or configuration to make the arrow left or right
      pointing.

** Bugs to fix
   1. Navigation of nested notes is spotty. =C-M-p= and =C-M-.= have trouble
      detecting nested notes.

** Trying out the refactor of org-noter-insert-note
   1. load `org-noter-dev.el'
      - defines org-noter-max-short-note
      - defines replacement for note insertion commands
      - sets default note insertion keybindings to the new commands
   2. Guiding principles for this refactor
      - The preferred title is the one the user enters in the minibuffer.
      - Selected text should be used in the note, either as the title or in the body
      - If there is no title input and no selected text, then use the default title
      - Refrain from making notes in the same location with the same title
      - Precise notes generally have different locations, so always make new
        precise notes
   3. Caveats
      - QUOTE block delimiters only appear on long selected text
      - There may be cleaner ways to implement some of the logical tests, namely
        empty string vs. nil situations.
      - Not all combinations of text selection, entry command and note title
        have been tested.
