* Org-noter + DJVU - A fork of [[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][org-noter]] with, hopefully, [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/djvu.html][djvu.el]] support.
** What is org-noter?
Org-noter is an org-mode document annotator. It is a rewrite of another project, [[https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave][Interleave]].
Read about org-noterâ€™s feature/usage/customization in its README [[file:README-orig.org][here]] or go visit its repository at [[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][github]].
** Added features
 - `org-noter` can be used on djvu file.
 - `org-noter-create-skeleton` now works on djvu and pdf file.
** Goals
 - [ ] Precise location support
   djvu.el have both graphical (via `djvu-image-mode`) and textual (default) modes so maybe
   the textual mode should handle precise location like nov.el and graphical mode should do it like pdf-tools.
** Caveats
*** Changed default keybindings
The key @@html:<kbd>@@i@@html:</kbd>@@ (lowercase i) for inserting note in the document buffer has been changed to @@html:<kbd>@@I@@html:</kbd>@@ (uppercase i) since it interfered with Djview Image minor mode key.
