* Some ideas
- Better import utility: maybe something like ~interleave-update-documents~ which will
  check if any document registered on the notes files is missing and mark it as such (put
  DOCUMENT MISSING on the heading?), and import every new document from the documents
  folder to the file, using the folder hierarchy as structure. An idea is to open each
  file on a side buffer and ask for the respective name of the heading, to ease the
  renaming.
  - Should this command also import things like images and text files?

- Should the package be able to annotate other types of files???

- Add commands like ~interleave-rename~ and ~interleave-delete~ which work on the document
  file instead of the heading?.. ~interleave-delete~ could delete all documents in a
  subtree, maybe with a prefix arg?
